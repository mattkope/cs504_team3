# Note:
You need to read the documentation on how to authenticate with the kaggle API. You need to first create a json token file. This short video shows where to get it along with where to put it in your computer system so you don't have errors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcV0hDkfzs&t=230s

There are multiple different ways to authenticate. The API example shows putting the .json in the active directory, so it pulls from that in the first block of code. Since then I have put it in the .kaggle/ directory so it automaticially checked on my system. 

The documentation links are the following:
- https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api
- https://github.com/Kaggle/kagglehub

## Brief Descriptions of Uploaded Datasets:
- API - example notebook using the origanol link to eccomerce data showing how to structure json code (don't run this notebook locally copy first code block). 
- Main - the main notebook that we should use going forward
- cleaned - how the data was cleaned for Main and cleaned kaggle eccomerce dataset

Add required packages to requirements.txt. It would be even better if you specified verison number.
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Kaggle use
If you are unable to run the dataset locally, using kaggle would be your best option. We can then commit your changes to main. The dataset will be stored in Kaggle.
