# CS 504 Team 3 Project 🧑‍💻👩‍💻

## Brief Descriptions of Folders

- Aporiori:
    - Azure Databricks Notebook that utilizes the FPGrowth algorithm to do Market Basket Analysis.
    - Loads in data using Kaggle API commands and not kagglehub using .json in local directory.
- kmeans:
    - Azure Databricks Notebook that utilizes the Kmeans algorithm to group two feature variables.
    - Loads in data using Kaggle API commands and not kagglehub using .json in local directory.
    - Contains coding template in readme.md.
- main:
    - Presents how the data was cleaned in cleaned.ipynd.
    - Showcases how to load kaggle.json from Jupyter directory and how the datasets are joined in Main.ipynb
    - Contains requirements.txt of packages needed as well, which can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - The .gitignore file ignores .json file that is put in the main github folder.

## Azure
Azure is used to gain access to data analytics software like Databricks. Databricks has Spark preconfigured on the instance. Students get a free 100$ credit to spin up compute resources.

## Kaggle 
Kaggle is mainly used to house the data as up to 100 GB can be stored for free. Kaggle can also provide notebooks with pyspark in case teammates don't have the necessary compute power to run the datasets locally. Copy and Paste the code from linked notebooks to newly created notebooks.

- Notebook joining with pyspark (preferred): https://www.kaggle.com/code/matt2434/import-using-pyspark
- Notebook joining with pandas: https://www.kaggle.com/code/matt2434/cs-504-project

## Kaggle API
The Kaggle API is used to interface between Kaggle and your coding environment. You need to first create a json token file and put it in the .kaggle/ local directory, or load the .json using the provided code in main. When you call the Kaggle API for a download for example, the files are stored locally in a specfic path. If you are using the cloud, the files are also stored in a specific path in that environment. 

Refer to the documention below for more detailed information:
- https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api
- https://github.com/Kaggle/kagglehub

## Setting up the Environment
- Click on your Kaggle profile picture in the upper right hand corner -> Click on Settings -> Scroll down and Select Create New Token under the API section.
    - A .json file should have downloaded
- Take created .json file and put in directory `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json` on Windows and `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` on Linux, OSX, and other UNIX-based operating systems
    - Doing this step will automatically authenticate token going forward
- Install Kaggle in python environment using the command `pip install kaggle` & `pip install kagglehub` (if using kagglehub statement)
- To load directly put the .json in your active Jupyter directory and run the first code block in main.ipynb
