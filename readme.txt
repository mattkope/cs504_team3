# Note:
You need to read the documentation on how to authenticate with the kaggle API. You need to first create a json token file. This short video shows where to get it along with where to put it in your computer system so you don't have errors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcV0hDkfzs&t=230s

There are multiple different ways to authenticate. The API example shows putting the .json in the active directory, so it pulls from that in the first block of code. Since then I have put it in the .kaggle/ directory so it automaticially checked on my system. 

The documentation links are the following:
